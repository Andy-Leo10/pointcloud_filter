# PointCloud Filter - ROS2 Package

## Overview
`pointcloud_filter` is a ROS2 package designed to process and filter 3D point clouds from a LiDAR sensor. It removes unwanted rings (caused by secondary LiDAR reflections) and filters out points belonging to the robot itself. The package also projects the 3D point cloud into a 2D `LaserScan` message for use in SLAM and mapping.

## Features
- **Removes unwanted LiDAR rings** (caused by secondary pulse returns).
- **Filters out points belonging to the robot's own structure**.
- **Converts a 3D point cloud into a 2D `LaserScan`** for navigation and SLAM.
- **Optimized using C++ & PCL** for real-time performance.
- **Easily configure via rqt** or command line parameters.
- **Output frame transform** if needed.
## Limitations
- **Output frame transform** requires that axis are aligned (no rotations between frames)
